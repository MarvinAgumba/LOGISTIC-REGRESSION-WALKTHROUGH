# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION-WALKTHROUGH

This repository shall give us a complete guide to how to go about a complete logistic regression problem. 
We shall use various datasets to guide us through a complete data science process from understanding the problem to preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and model deployment.

We shall look at:
 - A complete step-by-step logistic regression using Statsmodels & Scikit-Learn (*Titanic Dataset*)
 - Model Validation: Classification metrics (Evaluation of classification models; Confusion Matrix; Recall; Precision; F1 & Accuracy Scores using Heart Disease Dataset)
 - Model Validation: ROC CURVES & AUC: ROC graphs allow us to determine optimal precision-recall tradeoff balances specific to the problem we are looking to solve
 - Dealing with Class Imbalance (Examples using Mobile App and Credit Card Datasets)
 - Implementation of Bayes Theorem (Bayes Classification: using heart disease dataset & looking at its implementation in documentation classification with Naive Bayes)
 - Modeling using various classifiers: Decision Trees & KNN Classifiers (*Play Tennis Dataset*, *Banknote Authentification Dataset*, *Titanic Dataset*
 - Ensemble Methods: The idea is to bring together multiple models to use them to improve the quality of your predictions when compared to just using a single model. (Random Forest; GridsearchCV; Gradient Boosting; eXtreme Gradient Boosting - *XGBoost*; using the following datasets for illustration purposes: *Wine Quality*, *Salaries*, *Indians Diabetes*)
 - Pickle & Model Deployment: Model deployment goes beyond model persistence to allow your model to be used in many more contexts
